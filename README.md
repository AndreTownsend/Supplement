**Metrics**


The first phase involves clarifying the research questions. Here, we ask: What are the key trends in supplement use globally? Which regions are the dominant markets, and how do usage patterns differ by gender and age? Additionally, what is the average spending on supplements across different regions, and what are the regulatory challenges, such as lawsuits related to misleading claims? Finally, how do consumers perceive the scientific backing of these supplements? This set of questions directs our inquiry and guides the subsequent phases of data collection and analysis.
